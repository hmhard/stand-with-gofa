### Incident Overview

Heavy rains on 21 and 22 July caused three successive landslide incidents in a mountainous area in Gezei Gofa Woreda of Gofa Zone, South Ethiopia Region, according to local authorities.

Over 250 people have reportedly died and more than 14,000 people affected, including 6,750 people in Koncho Gozji Kebele and 7,765 people in Koncho Wiza Kebele as of the morning hours of 23 July.

Amongst the deceased are a kebele chairperson, member of the local police, health extension workers, and personnel from the Bureau of Agriculture who were on site providing support after the initial incident on Sunday, 21 July.

Search and rescue operations are ongoing, under the leadership of local authorities with the support from the Ethiopian Red Cross and community members. The death toll is expected to rise, according to local authorities. A similar, but lower-scale landslide incident had occurred in May 2024 in the same area, where more than 50 people had died. Weather extremes, such as floods and droughts, have been major drivers of humanitarian needs in Ethiopia.
